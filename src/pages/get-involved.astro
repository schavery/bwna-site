        While the Beaumont-Wilshire Neighborhood Association is officially guided by a volunteer 
        board of directors, the strength of our community lies in the many residents who step 
        up to provide valuable input, lend their time, and support neighborhood initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        From event planning to advocacy and cleanup efforts, our work is powered by neighbors 
        who care deeply about making this a vibrant, welcoming place to live.
