      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        The Beaumont-Wilshire Neighborhood Association (BWNA) is one of 95 officially recognized 
        neighborhood associations that are part of Portland's historic, nationally renowned 
        tradition of local volunteer activism and involvement.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Membership in BWNA is open to all residents, non-resident property owners, government 
        agencies, businesses, and nonprofit organizations located within the Beaumont-Wilshire 
        neighborhood boundary. The BWNA boundary area includes much of the Fremont and NE 42nd 
        Avenue business districts, Beaumont Middle School, and Wilshire Park.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>There are no dues or initiation fees</strong> required to be a member of BWNA 
        or participate in its activities. Bimonthly general membership meetings are open to all 
        and consider neighborhood concerns and allow neighbors to learn about various topics.
      </p>

  <!-- Mission Statement -->
  <section class="page-section">
    <div class="container content-width">
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The mission of BWNA is to enhance the livability of our neighborhood by undertaking 
        various neighborhood improvement projects, examining local issues, and serving as a 
        conduit for communication between neighbors, government agencies and officials, area 
        businesses, and other neighborhood institutions and groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to diversity and equity in all our activities. We work closely with 
        the Beaumont Business Association and are allied with eight other nearby neighborhood 
        associations through the Central Northeast Neighbors coalition.

    <div class="container content-width">
      <h2>Inclusion Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The Beaumont-Wilshire Neighborhood Association is committed to diversity and equity 
        in all our activities. We welcome and celebrate everyone in our neighborhood and, as 
        per our longtime by-laws, condemn any form of discrimination, exclusion, or expression 
        of hatred based on race, ethnicity, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender 
        identity, age, disability, legal citizenship, national origin, income, political 
        affiliation, or any other basis of personal identity people might use to divide us.
      </p>
      
      <p>Accordingly, we pledge:</p>
      <ol style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">To listen and learn, and to assess our own practices and policies in regards to equity and inclusion.</li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">To seek advice on how to combat racism in our neighborhood and our city, and welcome feedback that makes us better allies to our neighbors of color.</li>
        <li>To develop ways we can confront discrimination and support cooperation among Beaumont-Wilshire neighbors.</li>
