Fellow Beaumont-Wilshire Neighbors,

As I write this message for the start of 2026, I find myself reflecting on what makes our neighborhood special—and it's not just the beautiful tree-lined streets or our wonderful local businesses. It's you, our neighbors, who show up to meetings, deliver newsletters, plant flowers in the park, and wave hello on your morning walks.

## Looking Back at 2025

Last year was one of our most active years yet. Our dedicated team of newsletter carriers delivered over 15,000 copies of the BWNA Newsletter to doorsteps throughout the neighborhood. We hosted successful community events including the beloved Art & Garden Tour, our recycling events, and neighborhood cleanups that brought dozens of volunteers together.

I want to extend special thanks to everyone who contributed to these successes. Your volunteer hours add up to something truly meaningful.

## What's Ahead in 2026

This year, we're focusing on a few key priorities:

**Improved Communication:** We're working on making it even easier for neighbors to stay informed about what's happening in Beaumont-Wilshire. Our new website (you might be reading this there!) is part of that effort.

**Community Events:** We're planning to bring back all your favorites—the recycling events, spring cleanup, and Art & Garden Tour—plus some new gatherings we think you'll enjoy.

**Civic Engagement:** With changes happening at the city level, your neighborhood association remains committed to being your voice in conversations that affect our community.

## Get Involved

Whether you have an hour a month or a few hours a year, there's a place for you in BWNA. Join us at our next general meeting on February 9th at 7 PM at Sylvan Learning Center. Come meet your neighbors and learn what we're working on.

Here's to a wonderful 2026!
