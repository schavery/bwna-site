# BWNA Website

The official website for the Beaumont-Wilshire Neighborhood Association, built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## 🚀 Quick Start for Volunteers

**You don't need to be a programmer to update this website!** Most content updates involve editing simple text files.

### What You Need

1. A GitHub account (free)
2. A text editor (even Notepad works, or use GitHub's web editor)
3. 10 minutes to learn the basics

### How to Update the Site

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo (first time only)
git clone https://github.com/schavery/bwna-site.git
cd bwna-site

# 2. Install dependencies (first time, or after pulling new changes)
npm install

# 3. Start the local dev server to preview your changes
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:4321

# 4. Edit content in src/content/ (see Common Tasks below)

# 5. When you're happy, commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push
```

Pushing to `main` triggers an automatic build and deploy — no extra steps needed.

You can also skip local setup entirely and edit files directly on GitHub. Changes to `main` will auto-deploy either way.

## 📝 Common Tasks

### Adding a New Event

1. Create a new file in `src/content/events/` named something like `2026-03-15-spring-cleanup.md`
2. Copy this template and fill in your event details:

```markdown
---
title: "Spring Neighborhood Cleanup"
date: 2026-03-15
time: "9:00 AM - 12:00 PM"
location: "Wilshire Park"
address: "NE 33rd & Skidmore"
type: "community"
---

Join your neighbors for our annual spring cleanup! We'll be picking up litter,
pulling weeds, and beautifying our public spaces.

Bring gloves if you have them. Trash bags and tools provided.

Contact: events@bwnapdx.org
```

3. Save the file and commit to GitHub. The site rebuilds automatically!

### Adding Newsletter Content

For a web-native newsletter article:

1. Create a new file in `src/content/newsletters/` like `2026-01-presidents-message.md`
2. Use this format:

```markdown
---
title: "President's Message"
issue: "Jan-Feb 2026"
author: "Al Ellis"
---

Your article content goes here. Just write normally!

You can have multiple paragraphs.

## Subheadings Work Too

And [links to things](https://example.com) are easy.
```

### Updating Board Member Info

Edit `src/pages/about.astro` and find the `boardMembers` list near the top. Update the relevant entry:

```javascript
{ name: "New Person", role: "Board Member", since: "2026", email: "email@bwnapdx.org" },
```

## 🤖 Getting Help from AI

One of the best things about this setup is that AI assistants (like Claude) can help you with almost anything:

**Example prompts:**
- "Here's the event details: [paste info]. Can you format this as a markdown event file for our Astro site?"
- "I need to add a new page for the Art & Garden Tour. Can you create the file?"
- "The newsletter PDF is attached. Can you convert the President's Message into a web article?"
- "How do I add an image to the homepage?"

The AI can read all the code and understand exactly how the site works because it's all simple text files.
