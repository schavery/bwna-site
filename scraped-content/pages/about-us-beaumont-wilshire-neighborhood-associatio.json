My partner Katie and I relocated to PDX after a 7-month road trip in 2021, during which we fell in love with Portland and Beaumont-Wilshire. Morning walks to Prince Coffee, picking up games at Puddletown, and taking my pup Oakley to Wilshire Park are some of my favorite B-W activities. I’m passionate about creating experiences that make people feel welcome and excited to live in this neighborhood, and I hope to leverage my background in event production, business strategy, and community management to make an impact. Originally from central New York, so…Go Bills!\"",

We work closely with the Beaumont Business Association and are allied with eight other nearby neighborhood associations through the Central Northeast Neighbors coalition.\n​\nBWNA produces a free bimonthly newsletter that is distributed to the doorsteps of over 2,600 neighborhood residences and businesses by volunteers.
